                <p class="game-introduction-text">There is a lawn near your house and there are a lot of zombies on the oposite side of it. You should protect your house from zombies with the help of plants. Each plant has its special usage - a pea shoots out grains of pea and destroys zombies, a sunflower gives additional suns, a cherrybomb explodes and destroys zombies too. You should plant them and collect suns to get more seedpackets. The game has three levels. Each level is different from others by the number of lawn rows, species of plants and zombies.</p>
                <p class="rules-caption">The rules of the game are very simple</p>
                <ul class="rules-description">
